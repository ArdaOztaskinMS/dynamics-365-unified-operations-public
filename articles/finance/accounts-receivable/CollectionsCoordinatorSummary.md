# Collections coordinator summary

> [!NOTE]
> Some or all of the functionality that's mentioned in this article is available as part of a preview release. The content and the functionality are subject to change.

This article describes how to enable the optional Summary by Copilot on the **Collections coordinator workspace**. For more information on how to use this workspace see the [Collection coordinator workspace](collectionsworkspace.md).


## Turn on Copilot support for the Collections coordinator workspace
The features **Collections coordinator workspace** and **Collections coordinator summary** are on by default in 10.0.38 in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. 

> [!NOTE]
> As of version 10.0.40, and in the proactive quality updates (PQUs) for version 10.0.39 and 10.0.38, the features **Collections coordinator workspace** and **Collections coordinator summary** are set to On by default in Feature management. If they are not set to On by default you will need to enable them in Feature management.

The workspace can be used either with or without its AI-powered Copilot functionality. To use the Copilot functionality in the workspace the **Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance** app must be installed on your Dataverse environment. For more information see Enable Copilot in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. 

Use this feature to get an AI-generated summary of a customer's overdue invoices, payment history and remaining credit in the **Collections coordinator workspace** and to create a draft reminder email that is AI-generated. This feature is powered by Microsoft Azure OpenAI's large language model and is designed to reduce the time that you must spend reviewing collections details for your customers. 

This feature has three purposes:

- Provide customer account information.
- Help you make better decisions about your customers.
- Increase efficiency by drafting reminder emails that you can edit and then send to your customers.. 

## Country/region and language availability
This copilot feature was validated for [these languages](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2270154/). While it can be used in other languages, it may not function as intended. Language quality may vary based on the user’s interaction or system settings, which may impact accuracy and the user experience. 

## Summary by Copilot
Navigate to **Credit and collections > Workspaces > Collections coordinator workspace**. This page gives an overview of activities assigned to a collections coordinator (collections agent), the customers with the highest balances and the customers with the most overdue amounts. To get to the **Collections coordinator details select any customer name** or when a Customer account is selected at the top, **View customer details** can be selected. This takes you to the detailed page where you can see the Summary by Copilot. Azure OpenAI is used to generate the results in the Balances and payment history, based on the data in Finance and the provided prompts. All calculations are done in Finance. The summary is based on the amounts for the selected customer’s payment history for the past year, outstanding debt amount and invoices for the last six months.  

## Generate a reminder email

To have AI generate a draft email in the form of a reminder letter, select **Create reminder email**. You receive the following message:

> A reminder email will be created with AI. Make sure AI-generated content is complete, accurate, and appropriate before using. Do you want to create the email?

To return to the **Collections coordinator** workspace without generating an email, select **No**. To generate and open a draft email in your default email service, select **Yes**. Azure OpenAI services incorporates robust filters and safeguards to help prevent offensive, destructive, or abusive content from being created by using this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> The email is generated by using AI and Finance data, and the content is a suggestion. It's your responsibility to review and edit the suggested content to ensure that it's complete, accurate, and appropriate before you send the email.
