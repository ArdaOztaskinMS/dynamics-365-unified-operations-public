# Overview of enabling Copilot capabilities and features for finance and operations apps

Many (but not all) Copilot features in finance and operations apps require that you install and setup the basic Copilot capabilities for finance and operations apps. For some features, this foundation is all that's needed, but other features may require additional installations and/or feature management.
