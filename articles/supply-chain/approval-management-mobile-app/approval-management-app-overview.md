# Approvals Management mobile app overview (preview)

Many businesses make use of approval workflows to make sure new requests (such as proposed purchase requisitions and purchase orders) are valid, in-budget, and in line with all business practices and standards. Unfortunately, this extra layer of security can sometimes add delays to the purchasing process. Therefore, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management now provides a mobile approval experience, which adds flexibility, efficiency, resiliency, and responsiveness to the approval process.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

The Approvals Management mobile app provides the following capabilities for managing approval requests:

- View requests assigned to you.
- Approve or deny requests.
- Delegate requests to another approver.
- Ask requesters to make changes.

The following image shows an example of the Approvals Management mobile app being used to manage multiple purchase order requests.
