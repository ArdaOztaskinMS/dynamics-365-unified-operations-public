# Approvals Management mobile app overview (preview)

Many businesses make use of approval workflows to make sure all new purchase requisitions and purchase orders are valid, in-budget, and in line with all business practices and standards. Unfortunately, this extra layer of security can sometimes add delays to the purchasing process. Therefore, Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management now provides a mobile approval experience, which adds flexibility, efficiency, resiliency, and responsiveness to the approval process.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

The Approvals Management mobile app provides the following capabilities for managing approval requests for purchase orders and purchase requisitions:

- View requests assigned to you.
- Approve or deny requests.
- Delegate requests to another approver.
- Request a change to a request.

<!--KFM: Update the following licensing details as needed -->

> [!NOTE]
> Use of the Approvals Management mobile app is covered by the *Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management* user licenses. Using the app requires a *Dynamics 365 Operations â€“ Activity* license. Licensing terms are subject to change without notice. For complete and up-to-date licensing information, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=866544).

The Approvals Management mobile app replaces the now-deprecated [Purchase order approval mobile workspace](../procurement/purchase-order-mobile-workspace.md).

## Set up approval workflows

To enable the approval process for purchase orders and purchase requisitions, you must set up approval workflows in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. For more information, see [Workflow system overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/overview-workflow-system.md), [Purchase requisition workflow](../procurement/purchase-requisitions-workflow.md), and [Procurement and sourcing workflows](../procurement/procurement-sourcing-workflows.md).

One your approval workflows are set up, approval requests will appear in the Approvals Management mobile app just as they do when the same user signs in to Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management to manage approvals in the web client.
