# Applicants in HR recruiting app (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

This article describes applicants and activities in the HR Recruiting app in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Candidates who submit their applications for job vacancies are applicants. The recruiter can view the applicants by going to **Job ads** > **Applicants**.

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

## Applications
An application is created when a candidate applies for a job. The application includes the interview process of the candidate.
To view the application, follow these steps:
1. Click **Job ads**.
2. Click on the job ads for which you want to see the application.
3. Select **Applicant** tab.

### Application status
Every application has several statuses that show the different phases of application. There are internal and external application status. Internal status shows the internal process that is relevant for the recruiter. The internal status is hidden from the candidate. External status tells the candidate what the status is of their application.

Available statuses are:

|Scenario |	Internal	| External|
|------|----------|----------|
|The application is submitted.|	Applied|	Submitted|
|The application is in progress.	|In progress|	In progress|
|The applicants are set to hire.|	Ready to hire|	In progress|
|The applicants are rejected.|	Rejected|	Rejected|
|The application is withdrawn.	|Rejected|	Withdrawn|

### Delete applicant
Recruiters can delete one or more applicants at a time.
To delete the applicant, follow these steps:
1. Go to **Job ads** > **Applicants** > **Applicant**
2. Click **Delete applicant**.


### Activities

The hiring template used when creating the job ad is shown in the activity. Recruiters can use stages and steps to manage the application process. Each application has its own activities to record the information about the candidate's hiring process. They can assign the interviews for each stage or steps.
To go to activities, follow these steps:
Go to **Job ads** > **Applicants** > **Applicant** > **Activities**.
