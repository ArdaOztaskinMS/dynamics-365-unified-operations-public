# Using the dashboard in the Recruiting app 

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

This article describes how to use the dashboard in the Recruiting app in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

## Dashboard

On the homepage of recruiting add on app, when you start the application, is the dashboard. It displays a summary of how the recruiting process is going. 
The following built-in charts are available:
 - Job ads by status
 - Upcoming interviews
 - Pending approvals
 - Ready to hire candidates

### Job ads by status
This pie chart displays the different statuses of the job ads that the user has been part of. For example, a recruiter has made or participated as a hiring team member in four job ads. Out of four, one is draft, 
another is in-progress, and two are completed. This chart displays all four jobs by their status. Users can access the summary of job ad.

### Upcoming interviews
This is a list view that shows all the upcoming interviews for the user.

### Pending approvals
This list view shows the pending approval list for the user who needs to approve them. This helps the approver see all the pending approvals that need user action.

### Ready to hire candidates
This line chart displays the number of candidates who have been marked as hired from the recruiting add on app. This helps the user to see how many candidates have been hired over different years. Users can also 
drill down the charts by selecting another attribute. For example, users can break down this chart by month.

Note: The drill down can't be saved for later use.
