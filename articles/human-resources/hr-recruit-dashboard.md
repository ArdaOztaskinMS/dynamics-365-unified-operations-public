# Using the dashboard in the Recruiting app (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

This article describes how to use the dashboard in the Recruiting app in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

## Dashboard

On the homepage of recruiting add-on app is the dashboard. It displays a summary of how the recruiting process is going. 
The following built-in charts are available:
 - Job ads by status
 - Upcoming interviews
 - Pending approvals
 - Ready to hire candidates

[!INCLUDE [preview-note](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-d365.md)]

### Job ads by status
This pie chart displays the statuses of the job ads that the user has been conneced to. For example, a recruiter has participated as a hiring team member in four job ads. Out of four, one is draft, 
another is in-progress, and two are completed. This chart displays all four jobs by their status. Users can access the summary of job ad.

### Upcoming interviews
This list view displays all upcoming interviews for the user.

### Pending approvals
This list view displays a pending approval list for the user who needs to approve them. This helps the approver see all the pending approvals that need user action.

### Ready to hire candidates
This line chart displays the number of candidates marked as hired in the recruiting add-on app. This helps users see how many candidates have been hired over different years. Users can also drill down the charts by selecting another attribute.
