# Set up a prospect in the HR Recruiting app 

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

This article describes how to set up a prospect in the HR Recruiting app in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

## Prospect
Prospect is a possible applicant who fits a certain job role. Recruiters can find these candidates and mark them as a prospect. They can send an invitation to these prospects so that they will learn about this job
opportunity and apply for the role. 

There are two methods a recruiter can use to add the candidate to the prospect.
1. Create a new prospect in the job ad.
   - Click **Job ads** from the menu.
   - Click **Active job ads** from the job ads list.
   - Select **Prospect** tab.
   - Click **+New prospect**.
   - Select the candidate in the pop up. Other information will be automatically populated.
   - Click **Save** and **Close**.
    
2. Add prospects from candidate
 - Choose candidates from the left side of the menu. This shows all the candidates that are available.
 - Select one or more candidate, click **Add as prospects**.
 - A pop up appears and select one or more job where you want to add the candidate you selected as a prospect.
 - Select the jobs and click **Add**.
>[!Note]
> Click **Close** or click **X** to close the pop up.
 - Go to the job ad where you have put the prospect.
 - Click **Prospect** tab, the candidate is now a prospect.
 

### Move to applicants
Recruiter has the option to make the prospect an applicant directly. 
To make a prospect an applicant, follow these steps:
1. Go to **Job ad** > **Prospects**.
2. Select the prospects to turn into applicants.
3. Click **Move to applicant**.
4. The selected prospects disappear from the prospect list and shows up in the applicant tab for the same job ad.
You can select multiple prospects to move them as an applicant.

### Send invite
Recruiters can send the invitation to prospects to notify them about job openings. Prospects will get a notification in their email.


### Delete prospect

To delete a prospect, follow these steps: 
1. Go to **Job ad** > **Prospects**.
2. Choose the prospects to delete.
3. Click **Delete prospect**.
