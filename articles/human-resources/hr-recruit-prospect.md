This article describes how to set up a prospect in the HR Recruiting app in Dynamics 365 Human Resources.

## Prospect
Prospect is a possible applicant who fits a certain job role. Recruiters find these candidates and mark them as a prospect. They can send an invitation to these prospects to learn about this job opportunity and apply for the role. 

There are two methods a recruiter can use to add the candidate to the prospect.
1. Create a new prospect in the job ad.
   - Click **Job ads** from the menu.
   - Click **Active job ads** from the job ads list.
   - Select **Prospect** tab.
   - Click **+New prospect**.
   - Select the candidate in the pop up. Other information is automatically populated.
   - Click **Save** and **Close**.
    
2. Add prospects from candidate
 - Select one or more candidates from the list of available candidates.
 - Click **Add as prospects**.
 - A pop-up appears, select one or more jobs to add the selected candidate as a prospect.
 - Select the jobs and click **Add**.
>[!Note]
> Click **Close** or **X** to close the pop up.
